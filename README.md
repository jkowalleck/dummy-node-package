# GH NPM registry test dummy

test what is described at
<https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package>

the package is NOT set to "private" in its `package.json`,
instead the "publishConfig" was pinned.
this is an optional thing, that helped me not to publish this package on npmjs.org by accident.
